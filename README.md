#  Sound Demo iOS in swift

## I spent 1 hour to convert the project from swift 2 to swift 5, then I realize it is quite some changes. There are still bugs but the codes can still be used as a reference.


## This project is all about localized sound in iOS. I use scenekit for the demonstration

## demo1: you can move the object (sound source) around, further more, you can kick the ball and the collision sound is localized as well.

## demo2: a band is playing the muisc, you can move instruments around and all sound are loclized.
