#  Sound Demo iOS in swift

###  This project is all about localized sound in iOS. I use scenekit for the demonstration. I spent 1 hour to convert the project from swift 2 to swift 5, then I realize I dont have enough time for every changes. There might be crash here and there but the codes can still be used as a reference.

## Demo2: a band is playing the muisc, you can move instruments around and all sounds are loclized.
